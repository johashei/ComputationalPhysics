    "Have you been paying attention in your numerical analysis or scientific computation courses? If not, it could be a costly mistake. Here are some real life examples of what can happen when numerical algorithms are not correctly applied.\n",

    "1. [The Patriot Missile failure](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/patriot.html), in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, on February 25, 1991 which resulted in 28 deaths, is ultimately attributable to poor handling of rounding errors.\n",

    "2. [The explosion of the Ariane 5 rocket](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/ariane.html) just after lift-off on its maiden voyage off French Guiana, on June 4, 1996, was ultimately the consequence of a simple overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [The sinking of the Sleipner A](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/sleipner.html) offshore platform in Gandsfjorden near Stavanger, Norway, on August 23, 1991, resulted in a loss of nearly one billion dollars. It was found to be the result of inaccurate finite element analysis.\n",
