The numerical calculations are done by project1.cpp. The code is compiled and
run by project1.py or project1_timing.py.

In order to get solutions, call

Terminal> python project1.py <algorithm> <exponents>

<algorithm> ("general", "specific" or "LU") refers to the method for solving the
            1D Poisson equation.
<exponents> is a list or numpy.array of integers. The solution will have size
            (10^x + 2) for each element x in <exponents>
This creates datafiles containing the solution, the maximum relative error and
the runtime for each exponent. It also creates a plot of the solutions and their
maximum relative error, the plot is saved as an .eps file. Arrays of the step
length h, maximum error and runtime are printed to Terminal.


To time the solvers, call

Terminal> python project1_timing.py <algorithm> <exponents> <sample size>

<sample size> is the number of times the program will be run for each exponent.
This prints to Terminal a table of the mean time with standard error for each
exponent.
