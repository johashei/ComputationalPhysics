The numerical calculations are done by project1.cpp. The code is compiled and
run by project1.py or project1_timing.py.

In order to get solutions, call

Terminal> python project1.py <algorithm> <exponents>

<algorithm> ("general", "specific" or "LU") refers to the method for solving the
            1D Poisson equation.
<exponents> is a list or numpy.array of integers. The solution will have size
            (10^x + 2) for each element x in <exponents>
This creates data files containing the solution, the maximum relative error and
the runtime for each exponent. It also creates a plot of the solutions and their
maximum relative error, the plot is saved as an .eps file. The files are saved
to ./P1data. Arrays of the step length h, maximum error and runtime are printed
to Terminal.
Adding -d to the call will delete all files in the ./P1data directory.


To time the solvers, call

Terminal> python project1_timing.py <algorithm> <exponents> <sample size>

<sample size> is the number of times the program will be run for each exponent.
This prints to Terminal a table of the mean time with standard error for each
exponent.
