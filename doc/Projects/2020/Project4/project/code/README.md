The code can be compiled and linked using ```make all```.

```main.cpp``` is a parallelized program for solving the two dimentional Ising model. The number of threads ```MAX_THREADS``` is set whithin the program file. The parameters are supplied as command line arguments, in the following order:

```int L```: side length of lattice

 ```int MCS``` : number of Monte Carlo cycles
```int equilibration``` : number of Monte Carlo cycles to discard when computing expectation values
```double T_start``` : first temperature
```double T_end``` : last temperature
```double T_step``` : temperature step
```string spin0``` : initial state of the lattice should be "aligned", "random", or "default". Default is aligned if T<1.5 and random otherwise
```string outfilename``` : name of file to generate 

The first line of the generated file displays the input parameters

 L	MCS	equilibration	spin0

The remaining lines display the various expectation values per spin for each temperature

T 	E 	|M|	 E<sup>2</sup>   M<sup>2</sup> 	C<sub>V</sub> 	ùúí

The program ```not_para.cpp``` is not parallelized, and simulates the Ising model for a single temperature T. The command line arguments are ```L```,```MCS```,```T```,```spin0``` and ```outfilename```. 

The first line in the output file displays the four first arguments. The remaining lines display the energy, magnetization and number of accepted configurations for each Monte Carlo cycle.

Both of these programs use the ```Ising_2d``` class. See the source file ```Ising.cpp``` for information on this class. 

---

The python class ```Ising_2x2``` calculates the analytical expectation values for the 2x2 spin lattice.

The calls used to generate the data in the report are listed in ```commands.txt```. The figures  were created using the programs ```mcplots.py```,```histograms.py```, ```mainplots.py``` and ```interface.py```. These were made specifically for the data in this report and may need to be modified to work with other datafiles.
