The python script project2.py compiles and runs the code in the directory ./cpp_code/ 

Values which are set directly in main.cpp:

eigval_idx_max : maximum index for displayed eigenvalues, starting at 0.
tolerance : tolerance used to determine breakpoint of Jacobi's algorithm.
maxiter : maximum number of iterations for Jacobi's algorithm, regardless of weather tolerance has been reached.

Values requested upon running project2.py:

rho_0 : start point for the matrix A, should usually be 0.
rho_N : end point for the matrix A, approximation of infinity.
N : indicates dimention of A ( (N-1)x(N-1) )
algorithm : algorithm to apply. Should be 'Jacobi' or 'Lanczos'. 
M : for Lanczos' algorithm, the number of iterations.

the directory ./benchmarks/ contains examples of the terminal input and output when running project2.py
